          Every piece I create is a celebration of color, nature, and
          craftsmanship. Using resin as my canvas, I pour, shape, and design
          each bowl, tray, and coaster with care, blending vibrant pigments and
          textures to create something truly special for your home. Whether itâ€™s
          a beautiful resin turtle family or a abalone shell tray, my goal is to
          craft items that bring a sense of joy and wonder into your everyday
          life.
