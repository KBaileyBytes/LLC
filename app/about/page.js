              Hi Iâ€™m Leah, the artist behind Leelees Creationz. My passion for
              resin art started with a simple curiosity and turned into a love
              creating pieces with resin. I draw inspiration from my love of
              colour and texture. From abalone shells to sparkle, each creation
              is handcrafted with love. Thank you for visiting my website and
              supporting my small business. This is truly a dream come true.
            </p>
